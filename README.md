1. Let X and Y denote the coordinates of a point uniformly chosen in the circle of radius 1 centered at the origin. Find the joint density function fR,Θ(r, θ) of th代 写Math 425 Fall 2024 - HW 11Prolog
代做程序编程语言e polar coordinates R =√X2 + Y2 and Θ = arctan(X/Y).
2. If X1 and X2 are independent exponential random variables, both having parameter λ, find the joint density function fY1,Y2(y1, y2) with Y1 = X1 + X2 and Y2 = eX1.
3. Amy throws a fair die and simultaneously flips a fair coin. If the coin lands head, then she wins twice of the value that appears on the die. If tails, then she wins one-half of the die value. Determine her expected winnings.
4. If X and Y have joint density function

(1). Find E[XY ].
(2). Find E[X].
(3). Find E[Y ].
